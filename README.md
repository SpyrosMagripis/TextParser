# TextParser

This repository contains a simple Python utility for filtering lines in a text file based on multiple keywords.

## Usage

```
python filter_lines.py input.txt output.txt keyword1 keyword2 ...
```

The script writes lines that contain **all** provided keywords to the output file, prefixed with their original line numbers.

## Web App

```
A small web server using only Python's standard library lets you upload a text file and view matching lines in the browser.

```
python app.py
```
